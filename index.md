## About

### Short Biography
I have been a professor of mathematics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, since 2007. Before that I was a postdoc at UC, Irvine, in Orange County California, where I worked with John Lowengrub and Vittorio Cristini on complex fluids, crystal microstructure, and cancer progression. I obtained a BS degree in mathematics in 1996 from Clarion University and did graduate work in mathematics at Virginia Tech and Penn State after that. I received my PhD in 2003 from the University of Virginia, where I studied engineering physics, working with the nicest person in the world, Dr. William C. Johnson.

I teach courses in PDE, analysis, applied mathematics, and numerical analysis. With Abner Salgado, I wrote a graduate-level textbook entitled [Classical Numerical Analysis: A Comprehensive Course](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108942607), published by Cambridge University Press in 2023. You can check it out on Amazon or on Cambridge Core. We have another book coming soon on the topic of multigrid methods, focusing on basic theory and implementation in Matlab.

I have a YouTube channel, [WiseAppliedMaths](http://www.youtube.com/@WiseAppliedMaths), where I post lectures from some of the courses that I teach. My latest playlists are courses on [Asymptotic Analysis](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRC4Oo56zlKnNSCDSSny82UppC2-sCpeW&si=yZ-ix4LtlLVWlb5B), [Multigrid Methods](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRC4Oo56zlKk4oq6_nl38iy_R-12oOXj4&si=x_30AKDhYsrRKxJj), and [Finite Element Methods](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRC4Oo56zlKlDjmHBAFCQTRys9fUQHlr9&si=OPVgf0uRMw7l3mL8).

### Research
I work in the intersection of numerical analysis, partial differential equations, soft matter physics, and kinetic theory. I build models to study heat, mass, and ion flow and the formation of interfaces in complex fluids and materials, and I try to design efficient numerical methods to get approximate solutions.
